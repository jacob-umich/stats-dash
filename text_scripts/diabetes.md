Now, we can look at the diabetes prevalence per state from 2019-2022. The five worst states include West Virginia, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and Arkansas (13.6 to 15.7%) and the five best states are Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, and Colorado (7 to 8%). From our histogram, most states' prevalence is around 10 to 12%, showing that the prevalence of diabetes is high in most states. It is also interesting to note that West Virginia, Mississippi, and Arkansas also appear on the highest prevalence of disability by state list as well, while Colorado also has a low prevalence in that area.
