Tends for the worst-performing states appear stronger than for the best-performing states. Concerning the worst-performing states, Mississippi and West Virginia have the lowest life expectancy and some of the highest rates of diabetes and disability. Tennessee also makes the list for low life expectancy and high diabetes prevalence. 

For the best-performing states, trends are less apparent. Colorado has low rates of diabetes and disability but it does not have the highest life expectancy. Minnesota has amongst the highest life expectancy and lowest rates of disability but does not have an appreciably low diabetes prevalence.

Overall, trends seen in public health based on statistics affected by social determinants of health, specifically life expectancy, diabetes prevalence, and disability prevalence are seen in this dataset, but the trends are more apparent concerning the worst-performing states than the best-performing states.
